# BioMass

Welcome to the Biomass Mapping Tool repository! This project aims to provide researchers with a tool to get raw biomass potential from crop residues in any region across the world. This will allow them to get more insight on the potential of biomass in the energy sector. Most of the data being used has been taken from the GAEZ v4 by FAO & IIASA.
